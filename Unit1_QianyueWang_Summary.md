The 90-day rolling revenue trend demonstrates a **steady upward trajectory**, reflecting both healthy customer demand and solid operational consistency.

A deep dive into category performance identified **_Outerwear & Coats_** as the most dominant segment — leading not only in total sales (≈ $326 K) but also in profitability, generating **over $181 K in profit** (≈ 55 % margin).  
This validation confirms that revenue leadership in this category **translates directly into bottom-line success**.  
Performance is concentrated among a few key brands — **Carhartt**, **The North Face**, and **Canada Goose** — each contributing significantly to category strength.

## DIVE Reflection: The Importance of Validation

Our initial AI-assisted investigation surfaced *Outerwear & Coats* as the top category based purely on revenue.  
The **Validation** phase, where we recalculated profit and margin metrics using simplified SQL checks, was **critical**.  

It confirmed that the leading category was not only high-revenue but also **high-profit**, preventing the misstep of prioritizing volume over profitability.  
During validation, one AI-generated insight about “discount-driven growth” was corrected — deeper queries showed that discount variation was minimal, proving that **premium positioning**, not discounting, drove performance.  

This iterative validation strengthened confidence in the results and ensured that strategic recommendations rested on **verified insights rather than assumptions**.

## Recommendations

### 1. Capitalize on High-Margin Regions
**Insight:** China and the United Kingdom showed slightly higher per-item profits and stable overall margins (~ 55–56 %).  
**Action:** Focus on premium localization and targeted marketing in these regions to maximize profit yield.  
Highlight craftsmanship, exclusivity, and regional style preferences in future campaigns.

### 2. Leverage High-AOV Brand Insights
**Insight:** While *Carhartt* leads by sales volume, *Canada Goose* and *The North Face* outperform in **average order value (AOV)**.  
**Action:** Analyze their customer profiles and pricing strategies.  
Apply similar tactics — such as curated collections or limited-edition offerings — to elevate AOV across other sub-brands.
